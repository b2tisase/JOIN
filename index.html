          <p class="code" class="light" style= "text-align:left;" >The TBF PROJECT offers a unique way to get involved with projects at an intimate level. 
            It is a program in which you, along with a group of like-minded individuals, take responsibility for a specific project. <br> </p>

            <p class="code" class="light" style= "text-align:left;">TBF PROJECT volunteers will gain a first-hand understanding of issues related to education and witness a project grow over time. 
              With a secure source of long-term support, the project is able to establish firm roots and move towards self-sufficiency. <br> </p>




        <!--   <h5 class="code" class="center">THE TBF PROJECT STORY <br> </h5>

          <p class="code" class="light" style= "text-align:left;"> The TBF PROJECT began in 2021 with a small group of volunteers taking direct ownership of a project. It started in response to some mounting concerns: <br> </p>


          <ol>
           
           
          <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> New projects translated to increased responsibility.  <br> </li>

          <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> 	Transient presence of volunteers made sustained impact very difficult; burnout for existing volunteers was imminent.<br> </li>


          <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li>  	A field trip to Ethiopia and discussions with the project coordinators there showed that when involvement was lacking, donor sponsorship dropped out within 3 years. <br> </li>


        </ol> 








          <p class="code" class="light" style= "text-align:left;"> To guarantee long-term success, we had to make personal involvement the highest priority; fundraising, respected and sought in equal measure, took second place. <br> </p> -->




         <!--  <p class="code" class="light" style= "text-align:left;"> How does one translate the philosophy into practice? The answer to this complex problem was simple and rather elegant. 
            It came from a realization that it takes only a few committed people (the TBF Project) 
            to tackle a small education project. Under this vision, each volunteer takes personal responsibility in her/his project and fees. <br> </p> -->




            <p class="code" class="light" style= "text-align:left;"> Each TBF PROJECT MEMBER guarantees financial support of $200 per year towards their own project. Once committed, 
              the TBF PROJECT volunteer works on making the project self-reliant. As the teams are small, accountability is self-contained.
              Progress reports are posted on the web regularly, thus spreading awareness and enabling new volunteers to join the effort.
               TBF PROJECT MEMBERS are not confined to group meetings or their geographic location. They bridge the distances through commitment from the very beginning. <br> </p>




          <p class="code" class="light" style= "text-align:left;"> There was a perfect fit between the model and the ground realities. Within three years, two TBF project members emerged to set TBF Projects on a stable course for the long haul. <br> </p>


          <p class="code" class="light" style= "text-align:left;"> Initially, we proposed three TBF PROJECT MEMBERS (i.e., three involved owners) as ideal. Early on in the process,
             however, we identified three as being an artificial limit and a disadvantage, especially in handling large projects
              that needed a larger investment than $600 (three members contributing $200 each). So, we decided to call our organization The Bitew Foundation (TBF),
             where the number of volunteers is a variable. It made meaningful and poetic sense. This is how TBF PROJECT was born. <br> </p>





        <!--   <h5 class="code" class="center"> FEATURES OF A TBF PROJECT <br> </h5>

          <pclass="code"  class="light" style= "text-align:left;">Consistency with Mission Statement: The project must be consistent with The Bitew Foundation (TBF) mission statement. <br> </p>

          <p class="code" class="light" style= "text-align:left;"> TBF Project Members: Each TBF project includes members who share a common vision and take responsibility in ensuring 
            the project’s success. The recommended number of members for a project is no fewer than six and no more than eight. <br> </p>

          <p class="code" class="light" style= "text-align:left;">TBF Project Co-ordinator: He/she is the direct contact for that particular project. Ideally, this should be the person who first proposed the project. 
            Anyone who contacts this person should be updated on the project’s status and, if he/she so desires, get involved with the co-coordinator’s approval. <br> </p>

          <p class="code" class="light" style= "text-align:left;"> Approval of the project by a registered TBF branch: The project must be approved by a registered TBF branch. The accounts for the project will be maintained 
            and submitted quarterly to the IRS by the treasurer for this branch. Every year, the project must be ratified by the TBF branch. <br> </p>

          <p class="code" class="light" style= "text-align:left;"> Site visit prior to the start of the project and once a year after that: At least one person in the particular 
            TBF Project team must visit the site before the project is selected. Following this initial visit, 
            a site visit must be conducted once every year. For these subsequent visits, assistance may be sought from TBF-ETHIOPIA volunteers/partners. <br> </p>

          <p class="code" class="light" style= "text-align:left;"> Maintenance of web page for the project: Minimum information regarding the project must be maintained 
            on a website with the standard TBF template. The web-page may contain site-visit reports, financial statements, photographs of the project, 
            list of current TBF projects and the TBF Project brochure. A typical TBF Project website might look like this: http//www.tbf.org/project <br> </p>

          <p class="code" class="light" style= "text-align:left;"> Project updates: Reports are to be posted on the project website twice each year. These reports are meant to document progress for the benefit of those 
            involved in the project and the public at large. TBF-ETHIOPIA partners may fill in directly on the web-page after a site-visit. <br> </p> -->

         





        <h4 class="code"> Qualification of a TBF Project Member <br> </h4>

        <p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> Active involvement: Each member must have a vision for where the project is heading. 
          He/she must feel connected and involved with the project’s future and take ownership for its long-term success. <br> </p>

        <p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> Visit the project: Each member must visit the project site in Ethiopia at least 
          once within two years of joining the project. If a personal site-visit is not possible, a site-visit by a TBF-ETHIOPIA member may be arranged. 
          It is important for project members to become closely involved with children and volunteers at the project site. <br> </p>

        <p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> Financial support: The member guarantees financial support of at least $200 per year. 
          These funds must consistently be delivered to the TBF Project co-coordinator two months before the money is sent to the project. 
          The member also works with the co-coordinator to raise any further funds needed from the TBF branch or through other fundraisers. 
          Members must remember that if funds are not delivered in a timely manner, the stress put on the volunteers in Ethiopia distracts from the real work with the children. 
          Timely delivery of funds must be considered imperative for the project’s success. Students who cannot guarantee a $200 contribution at present may become TBF volunteers. <br> </p>


<!-- <h4 class="code" > The TBF Volunteer Philosophy <br> </h4>

<p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;">A college student’s resources are generally spread thin between classes,
 work, social life, etc. College students are a great asset to projects and are encouraged 
 to participate in publicity, fundraising, and other activities at the branch level. 
Students are invited to participate in TBF in whatever way suits their time and financial situation. <br>   </p>

<p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;">TBF allows students to take ownership of projects while they are still in college without the financial commitment of $200.00. 
They can participate in updating the web-page, discussing the project’s progress, 
and raising funds for the project. This college-level involvement builds a strong base that leads student volunteers to full membership after graduation.<br>  </p>

<p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> The qualities required of student TBF members are exactly the same as those for TBF project members, 
except that they may contribute less than $200 per year. The suggested annual contribution 
for TBF project members is $100 as an undergraduate student and $120 as a graduate student. 
This contribution can be waived depending on need. We would rather have a dedicated volunteer than money at this level. <br> </p>

<p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> Active participation in decision-making for the project: The TBF Project 
member votes on how the funds are to be used and ensures timely delivery of information and funds to the project coordinator. 
Active participation of all TBF Project members in decision-making is imperative for continued success. <br> </p>

<p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> Recruiting new TBF Project members: TBF members should help recruit new members and donors to ensure long-term sustainability for the project. <br>  </p>


<h4 class="code"> The Project Coordinator <br> </h4>

<p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> Shapes the overall direction of the project: He/she leads the team to make the project 
effective in its goals and ensure the project continues to get funded. He/she actively co-ordinates all project 
communications/reporting to keep everyone informed, including people in Ethiopia, TBF Project members and website visitors. <br>  </p>

<p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> Co-ordinates fund collection: He/she actively co-ordinates collection and delivery 
of funds to the project in a timely manner. If the funds collected by TBF members 
are not sufficient for the project expense, he/she works with a registered TBF branch to raise the amount needed. <br>  </p>

<p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> Obtains ratification by TBF: He/she ensures that a registered branch of TBF sanctions the project and ratifies it every year. <br> </p>

<p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> Recruits TBF Project members: He/she is responsible for recruiting TBF Project members as needed. He/she is also responsible for removing inactive TBF Project members. <br> </p>

<h4 class="code"> Advantages of The TBF Program <br> </h4>


<p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> SUSTAINED SUPPORT. This method of supporting a project ensures continuity of funding while the project becomes established and self-sustaining in the community it is serving. <br> </p>




<p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> DIRECT PARTICIPATION. The professionals who support the projects come from different backgrounds and are rich in experiences. 
The TBF Program ensures that donors are actively involved in the projects they support. They will be able to help the project not only with sustained financial support, 
but also with meaningful feedback. Moreover, visits by people who 
support the project are known to encourage the individuals running the project, the children the project is helping, and the community that the project serves.<br>  </p>






          <h3> The Action Plan for TBF Projects Group </h3>



          <h6> Social and economic development in Ethiopia can only be achieved when we educate children   <span class="w3-opacity"> who have not had access to education! </span></h6>
        </div>

        <div class="w3-justify">
          <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/267586/pexels-photo-267586.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1 " alt="Girl Hat" style="width:100%" class="w3-padding-16">





<p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> Purpose. TBF can be a source of hope to any child in Ethiopia in need of support. To make this a reality, the organization needs to have a presence in every region of the country and be 
accessible to the community and the child. Here are targets we must hit to reach this goal: <br> </p>





<p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> Short-Term Targets (2026).<br> </p>


<ol>
           
           
  <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> One TBF Project in N. Shew Region in Ethiopia <br> </li>

  <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> 	TBF Project participation from at least two new branches <br> </li>


  <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li>  	Initiate a TBF Project from within Ethiopia.  <br> </li>


</ol> 




<p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> Long-Term Target (2030). At least three TBF Projects in the North Showa province of Ethiopia.<br>   </p>

<h4 class="code"> Necessary Actions to Reach Goal <br> </h4>



<p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> To achieve the above short-term goals while simultaneously maintaining the high quality of the TBF Projects,
 we must focus on two key areas of responsibilities. These are: <br> </p>



<ol>
           
           
  <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> Project solicitation and administration (PSA) <br> </li>

  <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> 	Project monitoring and publicity (PMP) <br> </li>


</ol> 


     

        <h4 class="code"> Project Solicitation and Administration (PSA) <br> </h4>

        <p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> Identify one region in Ethiopia (suggested division appears in the table below) 
          and implement worthy TBF Projects in each district of the region. Each region will have a team headed by a coordinator who will: <br> </p>


          <ol>
           
           
            <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> Work with TBF members in Ethiopia and other volunteers to look for sustainable projects in those regions. <br> </li>
          
            <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> Interact with ethnic and other Ethiopian organizations to look for potential TBF Projects. <br> </li>
          
          

            <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> Write to political and administrative representatives in the regions to solicit worthy projects (work with established NGOs and the government, if necessary). <br> </li>
          
            <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> 	Match individual TBF Projects in their respective region of ownership.  <br> </li>

          </ol> 




      







          <h3> Project Monitoring and Publicity (PMP)  </h3>



          <h6> Our mission is not only to ensure that every child has access to a meaningful education,  <span class="w3-opacity"> but also to ensure that children’s nutrition and healthcare needs are met. </span></h6>

  <h4 class="code" > TBF Project Selection Guidelines <br> </h4>


  <P class="code" class="left-align light" >  [The following are the TBF Project selection guidelines] <br> </P>

        
  <P class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> TBF’s mission is to identify projects aimed at providing basic education and development to underprivileged children in Ethiopia. 
    Our emphasis is on projects that implement innovative approaches to education and basic development. <br> </P>



  <P class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> We ensure that the projects are funded and monitored constantly. We preferentially 
    fund projects in the state (country) with the lower literacy rate, and that is located away from an urbanized region. <br>  </P>


   <!--  <h4 class="code" > For Approving Project <br> </h4>



    <ol>
           
           
      <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> TBF will only work with groups that have no religious and political affiliations and that do not discriminate on the basis of caste, creed, religion or sex.<br> </li>
    
      <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li>  The project proposal must describe the project in detail, including its objectives, plan of action, number of children covered,
        number of people involved in the implementation of project, an itemized budget and any other relevant information. <br> </li>
    
    

    
      <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> The projects must be planned, managed and sustained by the group itself with little outside help.	 <br> </li>



           
      <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li>	The project must improve the general welfare of the community, emphasizing the education-related aspects. <br> </li>
    
      <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> The benefits of the project must be fairly distributed and should reach a maximum number of children. <br> </li>
    
    

      <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> Proposals requesting our support for a period of less than a year will be given priority. The group should convince TBF that it can sustain the project beyond this period.  <br> </li>
    
      <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> 	The group will be required to provide complete financial and narrative reports (and photographs, if possible) on the project’s 
        progress when desired by TBF (not more than four times during a year).  <br> </li> -->

          <h4 class="code" > How We Work <br>  </h4>


          <P class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> After evaluating a project proposal, we decide if we will fund it for at least ¾ years. The newly
           selected projects are assigned a coordinator who is responsible for monitoring progress and ensuring 
           that regular funding payments are sent. We work with other branches to share project funding efforts. <br> </P>

          <h4 class="code" > Submitting A Proposal – The Criteria <br> </h4>


          <P class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> TBF receives project proposals from different non-profit organizations and TBF representatives in Ethiopia.
             Members of TBF review these proposals carefully and correspond with the organization, soliciting 
             more information where required. Various factors are considered, including the organization’s history, 
             objectives of the project, proposed plan of action, number of children covered, 
            number of people involved in its implementation, itemized budget, and any other relevant information. <br> </P>
  
            <P class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;">Finally, the TBF member visits the project site (at his/her own expense) to evaluate first-hand the organization, 
              the site and the feasibility of the proposed project. It is only after she/he and the members 
              are completely satisfied that the organization meets all requirements, that the project is approved for funding. <br>  </P>
  
  
              <P class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> The branches of TBF are fairly autonomous, and it is their responsibility to choose projects 
                independently or work with other branches jointly in funding projects. TBF strongly encourages 
                members and people from the local community to recommend projects 
                about which they have first-hand information and which could be monitored by people they know well in Ethiopia. <br> </P>

          <P class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> After evaluating the proposal, TBF arranges a site visit, which is usually conducted by a member or someone else we rely upon, 
            such as a friend or relative. When the paper “plan” matches the actual site, the project may be approved for funding. <br> </P>

          <h4 class="code" > Monitoring of projects <br> </h4>


          <P class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> TBF requires the organization conducting the project to provide complete financial aid plans and narrative reports (with photographs,
             if possible) demonstrating the project’s progress. This documentation should be provided at least once a year, 
             but it may be requested as often as four times a year. In addition, 
            members of TBF may go to Ethiopia to visit projects unannounced to evaluate the progress and verify the reports sent by the organization. <br> </P>



            <P class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;">TBF reserves the right to terminate funding at any time if it is not completely satisfied with the progress.
               Realizing that the children involved are most affected if such a situation arises, 
              members of TBF invest ample time and energy to ensure that all is going well with the project. <br> </P>



            <!--   <h4 class="code"> Organizational Costs <br> </h4>


              <P class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> TBF has no organizational costs. TBF’s dedicated volunteers bear the cost of all administrative expenses from their own pockets. 
                100% of your contributions go towards supporting these projects in Ethiopia. <br> </P> -->

    <h4 class="code"> Start TBF Project <br> </h4>

    <p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> This website gives a few tips that can help speed up the process of creating a TBF Project. It assumes that: <br> </p>


      <p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;">(1)	A good project with a concrete proposal and dedicated group in Ethiopia has been identified. <br> </p>

        <p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> (2)	There is TBF Project Coordinator (TBFPC). <br> </p>



        <h4 class="code"> Getting Approval by TBF Branch <br> </h4>

        <p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> The first step is to initiate the project approval process by one of the TBF branches. You may start by contacting your closest branch. 
          Inform the project coordinator of that branch that you are interested in starting a TBF Project. <br> </p>

        <p class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> 	The branch project coordinator will guide you on the procedure or assign someone to do so. The TBFPC 
          or his/her representative might be asked to present the TBF Project to the branch projects group. 
          The TBF branch projects group will deliberate on the proposal and the plans and examine them critically. 
          They might seek clarification and/or give feedback based on their collective wisdom and experience. <br> </p>

    <h4 class="code" >  Creating A Webpage <br>  </h4>

    <P class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> Effective publicity for a project is helpful, especially for the initiation of TBF Projects. 
    One of the most efficient ways to raise this awareness is through the internet. The TBFPC 
    should create a web-page for the prospective project using the standardized template.
     The icon for the state or union territory where this project is located may be used in this standardized web-template. 
     The standardized template makes key quantitative information about the project easy to find for 
     the TBF members reviewing the project and anyone else who might be interested. The initial 
     location of the website can be according to the convenience TBFPC. Once the project is approved 
     by a branch, the website may be linked to the projects 
    page for that branch. For future information on the project’s web-page design, the TBFPC may contact Solomon K.  <br> </P>
    
    
    <h4 class="code"> Forming An e-Group <br> </h4>
    
    
    <P class="code" class="left-align light" style= "text-align:left;"> Effective communication and archiving of the project’s progress is key to success. Fortunately, 
      in this age of the internet, this is convenient to do. The TBFPC is recommended to create
      e-Groups to which he/she can add all persons interested in the project as members. All emails 
      sent to this e-Group are distributed to the members. At the same time, all the sent-mail related
       to the e-Group remains archived in the e-Group web-page. This web-page may be kept 
       accessible only to the e-Group member for privacy. The e-Group also provides 
       file space and calendar facilities for future use by the TBF Project. 
      In this way, the information about the project is at hand wherever there is internet access. <br> </P>
